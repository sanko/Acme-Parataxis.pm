# Building a .tar.gz that Ctrl-C can actually interrupt.
#
# Archive::Tar and Compress::Zlib are both C. Neither one of them has a chunked Perl-level API you can
# park in the middle of, so the reflex - wrap the call, get a cooperative program - does not work, and
# the honest version of this exercise is to *choose where the await boundaries go* and then measure
# where Ctrl-C actually lands.
#
# The shape:
#
#   1. A small input tree, and a per-file checksum computed in chunks. The chunk boundary is the await
#      boundary, so a cancel lands within one chunk of the signal rather than at the end of the file.
#   2. The archive, built with Archive::Tar. add_data() per file is interruptible between files;
#      write() is a single call into C and is not interruptible at all.
#   3. The cancellation, for real: a token on $SIG{INT}, a with_timeout scope, and the output file
#      cleaned up afterwards. A half-written .tar.gz is worse than no .tar.gz, and the demo says why.
#   4. Offloading the build to a thread, and the trap that comes with it: cancelling the await does not
#      stop the closure, so the file keeps growing after you have decided the run is over.
#
# Run it: perl -Mblib eg/tar_pack.pl [files] [bytes-per-file]
#
# Section 4 needs Acme::Parataxis::Blocking and a threaded perl. Without them it prints why and stops.

#   * write() only reaches the compressor when you hand it a FILENAME. $tar->write( $fh, 1 ) writes an

#   * iter() likewise needs a filename. Given a filehandle it returns a valid-looking iterator that

#   * Archive::Tar->iter() returns a CODE ref, not an object. There is no ->next_file. You call it.
#   * Archive::Tar has no addfile() at all. add_data() is the one that takes content or a filename.
#
# And gzread() overwrites the variable you hand it, including on the final zero-length read, so
# appending is the only safe accumulator - read straight into one variable and the last call erases

# 5. Two features in this distribution that must not be used in the same program.
#
# This section is a bug report, not a demonstration, and the numbers in it were measured on the
# threaded 5.44.0 build. It is here because the combination is easy to reach by accident: a program
# that turns on transparent unblocking to stop writing await_sleep(0) by hand, and then reaches for
# spawn_blocking for one long job.
#
# enable_transparent_unblocking() installs Acme::Parataxis::Compat, which overrides core file and
# pipe operations process-wide. threads->create clones the interpreter, overrides included, so a
# worker thread inherits them - and inside that worker there is no scheduler and no fiber, so the
# override tries to park a wait that cannot exist.
#
# What that costs, measured, reading a 12MB file in 64KB passes from a spawn_blocking closure:
#
#   transparent unblocking off   192 passes, 12582912 bytes read, exit 0
#   transparent unblocking on    the closure stops partway, and the Future carries
#                                "_park() must be called from inside a scheduled fiber"
#                                instead of anything to do with the file
#
# The second case is not a tidy error, though. At 4MB it prints
# "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" and then returns the right answer anyway; at 12MB it
# segfaults. A bare threads->create with the overrides installed and no scheduler involved is fine,
# so it takes both features together to corrupt the heap.
#
# Nothing in this file needs transparent unblocking - the reads are chunked by hand precisely so the
# await boundaries are visible and movable. If you do want both features in one program, keep the
# worker free of the wrapped operations, or do the I/O before the thread exists.
