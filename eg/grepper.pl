# A bounded-memory concurrent grepper, in the spirit of ripgrep, built on
# fibers. This is the case fibers exist for: one process, shared state, and
# plain synchronous-looking code (open/opendir/sysread) that would otherwise
# trivially serialize -- now fanned out over a fixed pool of worker fibers.
#
# Architecture, all of it on the Parataxis scheduler:
#
#   dir_generator (1 fiber)   BFS the roots, lazily discovering subdirectories,
#     pushes each directory onto $work (bounded: capacity == CONCURRENCY) with
#     a non-blocking try_put + yield, so a huge tree cannot balloon memory.
#     When the frontier is exhausted it parks CONCURRENCY sentinels, one per
#     worker, then retires -- every real directory is FIFO-ahead of them.
#
#   workers (CONCURRENCY fibers) get a directory, scan only its direct files
#     in 64 KiB chunks (maybe_yield between chunks, NUL byte = binary, skip),
#     and put each {file,line,text} match onto $hits (bounded: 4096). A full
#     $hits channel parks the worker: the result channel is the backpressure.
#
#   reaper (1 fiber) awaits the generator and every worker, then $hits->shutdown.
#
#   main (the run() body) drains $hits as fast as they land and prints them
#     in grep format, so a 10 GB log tree costs memory proportional to the two
#     bounded queues, not to the tree or the match count.
#
# Ctrl-C sets $stop: the generator bails out (parking the sentinels anyway so
# workers can retire) and the run winds down gracefully.
#
# Usage:  perl eg/grepper.pl [PATTERN [DIR ...]]
#   defaults search this module's own tree (lib t inc eg) for 'parataxis'.
