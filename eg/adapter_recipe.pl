# Turning a blocking call into an awaitable one.
#
# "Make this synchronous thing asynchronous" is one question with three different answers, and picking the wrong one
# costs you a latency bug that only shows up under load. This file measures all three, before and after the cheapest
# fix, so the trade-offs are numbers rather than assertions.
#
# The cheap fix is Acme::Parataxis::Compat, which makes sleep/read/sysread cooperative. It is opt-in, it is installed
# at run time, and an override is resolved when code is *compiled* -- so it covers the code below the install and
# nothing above it. That single rule explains most of what follows, including the limits.
#
# Run it: perl -Mblib eg/adapter_recipe.pl

# much of the program was frozen. Every measurement runs comparable work and reports both wall time and ticks, so
# "it did not block" is a number and not a vibe.

        # the handle does not change, and the wait moves from the OS thread into Parataxis.

        # Both steps matter. await_read is what makes the wait interruptible; the non-blocking handle is what stops
        # a stale readiness report from parking the thread anyway. Here the handle is still in blocking mode,
