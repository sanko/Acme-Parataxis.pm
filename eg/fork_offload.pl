# CPU offload for a perl that has no threads. spawn_blocking() needs a
# useithreads build because it clones an interpreter with threads->create; this
# demo uses spawn_blocking_fork(), which forks a child process instead and so
# needs nothing but fork(2). That is the whole reason it is a separate entry
# point rather than a fallback inside spawn_blocking: the two have different
# honest limits, and a caller should be able to see which one it asked for.
#
#   no threads at all  threads, threads::shared and Thread::Queue are never
#     loaded, so this runs on a perl built without ithreads and leaves the
#     property that loading Acme::Parataxis acquires no threads association
#     intact.
#   copy-in / copy-out  the child is a copy of your address space at the fork,
#     so the closure sees its args and whatever its captured lexicals held
#     then; the only thing that comes back is the frozen result. A die() in the
#     closure, or a result Storable cannot store, becomes a Future error.
#   process pool (set_max_blocking_forks)  cap on concurrent children; excess
#     spawn_blocking_fork calls park the calling fiber until a slot frees.
#   killable  this is the one thing the thread pool cannot do. A thread cannot
#     be yanked; a child is a process, so kill_blocking_fork() really stops the
#     work and the Future resolves with an error.
#   wall-clock only  real OS work cannot ride the mock clock, so this croaks
#     under run(virtual => 1).
#
# Requires a real fork(2): MSWin32 emulates fork with threads.pm, which is the
# very machinery this path exists to avoid. Without one this demo explains
# itself and exits 0 rather than dying.
#
# Usage:  perl eg/fork_offload.pl [--pool N] [--jobs N] [--burn MS]
#   runs $JOBS CPU closures (of ~$BURN ms each) through a $POOL-child process
#   pool, counts how many scheduler ticks a plain fiber completes while they
#   churn, checks every result, checks the concurrency cap, then demonstrates
#   kill_blocking_fork() on a runaway child and exits 0.
