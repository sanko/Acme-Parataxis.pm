# Turning a synchronous database driver into an asynchronous one.
#
# A driver is synchronous because every call blocks: it writes a query, waits
# for the server, reads rows. A fiber that calls one of those directly does not
# just block itself, it blocks every other fiber in the interpreter, because
# they all share one OS thread. The fix is not a faster driver, it is a driver
# that parks instead of blocking: same wire protocol, same SQL, same rows --
# the difference is that "wait for the server" becomes await_read() rather than
# sysread(), and the waiting fiber is suspended rather than stalled.
#
# Both halves are measured here against a real database. The database is a
# separate perl process, because a single-threaded parataxis interpreter
# cannot host both the server and a blocking client -- which is precisely the
# problem being demonstrated. It is a plain non-blocking round-robin server, so
# it answers many connections at once and each answer costs QUERY_LATENCY_MS
# of wall time. The client talks to it twice:
#
#   1. the synchronous driver -- one connection, QUERIES queries in sequence,
#      every call blocking. Total time is QUERIES x latency.
#   2. the asynchronous driver -- the same code with a parked transport, one
#      connection per query, all in flight together. Total time is one
#      latency, because the waits overlap.
#
# The two must return byte-identical rows, and the demo dies nonzero unless
# they do, the row count is right, the waits really did overlap, and the
# parked run really was faster.
#
# The second run also parks many fibers inside one closure. read_reply() is a
# single CV, and every concurrent client enters it and suspends there, so the
# interpreter holds QUERIES frames of the same sub at once. That is the shape
# a shared subroutine takes whenever a fiber waits inside a helper rather than
# inside the fiber body, and it is the shape that used to leave a fabricated
# CvDEPTH behind and take the process down with "Can't undef active
# subroutine during global destruction" on the way out. INSIDE_MAX is
# measured rather than assumed: if the waits had not actually overlapped,
# the demo would report that instead of claiming a speedup.
