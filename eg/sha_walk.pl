# Hashing a directory tree: File::Find + Digest::SHA, made cooperative.
#
# The reflex when a task is slow is to reach for async, and then spend a day making a synchronous walk yield and a
# synchronous hasher cooperate, and end up with a program that is not measurably faster than the one you started with.
# This file is the worked version of that, and the punchline is in the diagnosis near the end: the hasher was never
# I/O-bound. It is CPU-bound, and no amount of scheduling changes a CPU-bound program that has one thread.
#
# Five things get measured, each against a heartbeat fiber that ticks every 10ms so "did it cooperate" is a number:
#
#   1. File::Find. A synchronous recursive walk. What actually makes it hand the thread back is yield(), and
#      maybe_yield() does not - it is a preemption counter, and at the default threshold of 0 it is a no-op. That is
#      the single most common mistake in this file's genre, so it gets its own section and its own numbers.
#   2. Digest::SHA->addfile. XS. It does its own reading in C, where a Perl-level override cannot reach, so Compat
#      cannot help it at all. Measured, not assumed.
#   3. The same digest driven by a Perl read loop. Now the reads are reachable, so Compat does cooperate - and the
#      chunk size turns out to matter more than anything else in this file.
#   4. One fiber per file, bounded by a semaphore. Buys resource bounding, not throughput, and the numbers say so.
#   5. The diagnosis, and the one tuning knob that is actually worth reaching for.
#
# Run it: perl -Mblib eg/sha_walk.pl [files] [bytes-per-file]
