# Regression for the shared-pad wipe: CvDEPTH is one counter per CV, and every fiber that parks
# inside Channel::get leaves a live frame (and pad) behind in the shared PadList. When shallower
# frames leave, CvDEPTH dips below the deepest parked frame, and the next entry used to land on a
# parked frame's pad and overwrite its $self, @_, and my lexicals in place (fields, being
# instance-backed, survived; $self did not, so the victim died with an undefined receiver).
#
# Choreography: A, B, C, D park in get in that order; wake A and C so both leave and the depths
# dip; let both re-enter get (this is where C used to steal D's pad); wake C again so it vacates;
# then wake the victim D and the untouched control B. Every fiber must come back with its
# lexical, its own value, and no error.
