# M7: thin actors. `Actor->spawn(sub ($self, $msg) { ... })` runs the handler in a dedicated fiber that owns a
# bounded Channel mailbox; `ask` tags a message with a Future (the handler's return value travels back through it),
# `send` is fire-and-forget, and `stop` shuts down gracefully (draining what was already queued). Supervision is out
# of scope -- a handler die fails its own ask (or warns for a fire-and-forget) and the actor keeps running.
