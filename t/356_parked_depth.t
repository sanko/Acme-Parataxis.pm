# Regression test. Two or more fibers parked concurrently in the *same* CV used to leave that CV with a
# fabricated CvDEPTH that nothing ever withdrew, and perl then croaked "Can't undef active subroutine during
# global destruction" and exited 22. One fiber was fine. eg/affinity.pl -- a committed demo -- exited 22
# because of it, having printed a complete report first.
#

#   async {
#       my @f = map { fiber { await_sleep(0.001); 1 } } 1 .. 2;
#       say 'ok ' . scalar await $_ for @f;
#   };
#
# The cause was Pass 1b's pin. Pinning a CV's CvDEPTH above its live frame count is a loan: it makes the next
# ++CvDEPTH land on a pad of its own instead of aliasing a parked one, but the borrower only repays it by
# popping, and a pop restores CvDEPTH to that frame's own olddepth -- one level higher than it would have
# been without the pin. Each pop was individually correct, yet the counter settled one level too high per
# parker, so two parkers finished at 1 and twenty at 19. Pass 1c now hands the level back at the swap
# boundary, once no fiber claims the CV and no frame of it is live on the resuming stack.
#
# Every subtest below runs a child perl, because the croak happens during global destruction -- after
# done_testing, after the last assertion, once the test file itself is being finalised. There is no way
# to observe it from inside the test process, so the exit status of a real child is the only honest
# witness. Each case asserts the three things that together mean "clean": the work completed, the
# process exited 0, and the teardown croak is absent from the output.
#
# The three controls -- one parker, no parker, and two parkers that never overlap -- passed before the fix
# and pass after it, so a regression that only broke the concurrent case would still be caught. The two
# defect cases failed 4/4 before the fix and are what this file exists to keep failing if the pin ever
# stops being repaid.
#
# Known and still unfixed, tracked in TODO.md: a frame that leaves because perl *unwound* the scope rather
# than because the sub returned -- a die propagating out of the CV, a cancelled wait -- leaves a stale claim
# the registry never undercounts, so Pass 1c conservatively keeps the pin. In practice the fibre that died is
# torn down and destroy_coro purges the claim, after which Pass 1c settles; only a fiber that is never
# destroyed can leave the borrowed level standing until global destruction.
