# The drivers key their watch tables by descriptor number, and a number is not an identity: the OS recycles it the
# instant a handle is closed. A handle that is watched and then closed without unwatching leaves its slot behind, and
# the next handle to be given that number used to inherit it. The slot is what the driver consults before registering
# a handle with the underlying loop, so inheriting one meant the new handle was never registered at all -- and a fiber
# parked on it waits out its deadline for a readiness event nothing is going to deliver.
#
# That is the shape of the lost wakeup in t/256, reproduced here in miniature and on purpose. The failure is far too
# rare to catch by waiting for it, so this forces the collision: close a watched handle, then build pipes until the
# OS hands the freed number back. The first two assertions are red without the fix and green with it.
#
# Nothing here needs a fiber or a run loop. The defect is in the bookkeeping, so the bookkeeping is what is tested.

    #    number, so handing it a recycled number replaces the entry and it recovers by itself. IO::Async's Epoll
    #    backend keys the same table by descriptor but *also* remembers which handle it registered there: a re-watch
    #    with an unchanged mask falls through every branch and is dropped without a word, and the later unwatch finds
    #    a handle identity it no longer agrees with and croaks. It cannot be told to forget the old handle either,
    #    because that handle is closed and there is no descriptor left to look it up by. So on IO::Async nothing
    #    Parataxis does can be observed end to end here, and asserting it would either pass vacuously or report a
    #    red test for somebody else's bug. What Parataxis does own -- the two assertions above -- is asserted for both.
