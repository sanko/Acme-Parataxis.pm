# How many pairs to actually ask for, given a target. Every pair holds two descriptors open for the whole subtest, and
# the soft RLIMIT_NOFILE is not the same on every platform this runs on: Haiku and the BSDs ship far below the Linux
# default, so a fixed 300 used to die partway through the build with EMFILE and take the whole leg red. Rather than
# ask each OS what its limit is, try the real thing - open the pairs, and halve on EMFILE/ENFILE until one size fits.
# The probe runs in this same process against this same soft limit, so the number it settles on is the number that
# will still be there when the subtest asks for it.
#
# RLIMIT_NOFILE is not the only ceiling, and on NetBSD it is not the binding one. The platform's FD_SETSIZE bounds
# the descriptor NUMBER rather than the count: 300 pairs open 600 descriptors and reach fd 605, comfortably past
# NetBSD's FD_SETSIZE of 256 and nowhere near Linux's 1024, and an fd_set that size cannot name a descriptor at all.
# Two descriptors per pair, plus a listener and the handful of handles already open, is the budget that leaves.
# Measured from C because perl cannot measure it - `getconf FD_SETSIZE` is not a valid symbol and answers 20, and
# Fcntl::FD_SETSIZE() dies at runtime - and on NetBSD that number is the whole difference between this leg passing
# and not.
