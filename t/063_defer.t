# defer (run cleanup on every fiber exit), delivered by perl's native 'defer' keyword (v5.36+, experimental).
# A defer written lexically in the fiber body fires on the return path, the throw path, and the cancel path,
# exactly when the fiber's scope exits - before the coroutine is reaped.
#
# Busy-yield until a semaphore shows exactly $n parked fibers. Dies rather than spinning forever so a scheduling
# bug surfaces as a clear failure instead of a hang. Mirrors the pattern in t/062.
