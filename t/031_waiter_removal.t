# remove_waiter unregisters a parked fiber so the primitive will never wake it.
# A removed waiter stays parked forever, and its Perl object must live until the
# process ends (destroying a mid-park fiber became safe with the M0 C fix in t/046,
# but a removed waiter is never resumed, so its object is stashed in @parked and
# reclaimed by the runtime's own cleanup() during global destruction, as before).
# The block's run is ended with stop() so the deadlock detector is never reached.
