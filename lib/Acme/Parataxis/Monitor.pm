# A monitor is pure observation, like an Erlang monitor: it resolves exactly once, when the
# target fiber exits, to undef for a clean end or to the fiber's death error for a crash. It
# rides the target's existing on_ready/on_death slot, so it needs no scheduler change and
# never owns the target (no stop, no join-without-error semantics). Watching an already-dead
# target fires immediately, because the underlying Future resolves inline during construction
# (the target parameter's on_ready hook fires right there).
#
# The target is held strongly so a monitor never loses its subject; reapability is about the
# C coroutine slot (driven by the fiber's own completion), which the monitor cannot delay.
# The reverse edge is cut: the completion callback captures the monitor weakly, so dropping
# a monitor lets it (and its strong target ref) dissolve instead of lingering in the target's
# callback list.
