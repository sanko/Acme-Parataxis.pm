# A chainable FRP pipeline over bounded Channels: async stream stages. Every stage is a
# factory: it allocates its own bounded output Channel, spawns a background fiber that loops the input applying a
# callback, and returns a new Stream wrapping the output. Backpressure is free - a full bounded channel parks the
# stage's producer all the way upstream, which is exactly what t/057's parked_puts() counts.
#
# Teardown is the same everywhere: each stage's fiber ends its `while (my $x = $src->get)` loop when the upstream
# Channel shuts down, then shuts its own output down in turn, so a consume()'d chain unwinds fiber-by-fiber back to
# the source. `shutdown` releases the parked get()ers (Channel.pm's shutdown adjusts the get semaphore by 1e9), so no
# stage can park forever on a source that quit - the "zero leaked fibers" guarantee holds from the very
# first from_channel.
