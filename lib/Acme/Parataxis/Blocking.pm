    # Run a CPU-bound closure on a dedicated background Perl interpreter, with its result arriving as a normal Future.
    #
    # The C pool cannot do this: those workers execute C waits (sleep/read/write) only, so a real Perl closure needs a
    # real ithread. Each call therefore clones the interpreter with threads->create (the whole point of Loom's
    # worker_threads and the honest thread-per-task trade: the dense clone cost is paid per call, but the closure runs
    # in complete isolation and the scheduler is never touched while it does). The bounds and the copy-in/copy-back
    # rules are deliberate:
    #
    #   * capacity - at most set_max_blocking_threads() interpreters run at once (default 4, PARATAXIS_SB_THREADS or a
    #     call before first use change it). Excess spawn_blocking calls park the *calling* fiber on a Semaphore until
    #     a slot frees, so the bound is a true concurrency cap like the C pool's.
    #   * copy-in   - the closure sees only a snapshot of the caller's world taken at spawn: its args (threads->create
    #     args) and whatever its captured lexicals held at that instant. Threads share nothing, so in-place mutations
    #     and later writes to shared/holder state never leak back.
    #   * copy-back - the return value must survive threads::shared::shared_clone: plain scalars and nested
    #     arrays/hashes of them (blessed plain structures included) cross; an unshareable result (a CODE ref, a
    #     resource) becomes the Future's error instead. A die() in the closure likewise lands on the Future as its
    #     error.
    #   * no scheduler objects - the closure must not call back into Acme::Parataxis APIs (spawn_blocking or any
    #     blocking await) while it runs; the worker's interpreter is a copy and its scheduler state is read-only.
    #
    # The returned Future composes with await / with_timeout / with_cancel / wait_all exactly like any other, because
    # the harvest is a plain scheduler fiber resolving an Acme::Parataxis::Future. Cancelling the *await* does not
    # stop the closure (a real OS thread cannot be yanked); it only withdraws the waiter, and the slot is released
    # when the closure actually finishes. Wall-clock only: spawn_blocking croaks inside run(virtual => 1), since real

    # Run a CPU-bound closure in a forked child process and return its result as a normal Future.
    #
    # This is the same promise spawn_blocking makes, for a perl with no thread support. It is a separate entry point
    # rather than a backend switch inside spawn_blocking on purpose: the two have genuinely different limits, and a
    # caller should be able to see them at the call site instead of inheriting a silent per-build difference.
    #
    #   * no threads at all - the point. Nothing here requires threads, threads::shared or Thread::Queue, so a plain
    #     perl gets CPU offload and keeps the property that loading this distribution acquires no threads association.
    #   * copy-in by fork, copy-out by Storable - the child starts as a copy of the whole parent address space, so the
    #     closure sees the caller's world as it was at the fork: its args, and whatever its captured lexicals held
    #     then. Nothing the child does to memory comes back; the only thing that travels is the frozen result. A
    #     result Storable cannot store (a CODE ref, a resource) becomes the Future's error, as does a die().
    #   * the closure must not call back into Acme::Parataxis - the child's interpreter is a copy whose scheduler state
    #     is meaningless, and it holds copies of the parent's descriptors (including any attached driver's sockets), so
    #     a closure that reads or writes through one of those would act on a copy of a descriptor, not the original.
    #     Inherited descriptors also keep their ports busy until the child exits, which is worth knowing when a closure
    #     is short but a run is long.
    #   * cancellation kills - unlike the thread pool, this one can actually stop the work. Cancelling the *await*
    #     still only withdraws the waiter, exactly as with spawn_blocking, so nothing changes by accident; when you do
    #     want the work to stop, call kill_blocking_fork($future) and the child is signalled (TERM by default).
    #   * a harvester fiber always runs - it is scheduled independently of whether anyone awaits the Future, so the
    #     pipe is drained and the child reaped even if the caller never looks at the result. That is also what keeps a
    #     large result from deadlocking: a closure whose payload exceeds the pipe buffer blocks in write until the
    #     harvester's next chunk, which is the design working, not a hang.
