    # Base class for the event-loop drivers behind Acme::Parataxis->attach_loop(). A driver wraps an existing CPAN
    # event loop (Mojo::IOLoop, IO::Async::Loop, ...) so that await_read / await_write / await_sleep are serviced by
    # epoll/kqueue/select readiness instead of burning an OS-thread pool job per filehandle. The scheduler keeps its
    # own park/wake machinery; the driver only *tells* the loop which filehandles to watch and hands control to the
    # loop when every fiber is parked.
    #
    # Subclasses implement the loop-specific bit (watch_read/watch_write/unwatch/timer/cancel_timer/drive/poll_ready);
    # this base owns the bookkeeping -- which watches and timers are still live -- that the scheduler uses to decide
    # whether the loop still needs control (pending) and to tear the whole thing down between runs (reset).

    # True while this driver still has registered watches or timers. The scheduler's idle branch hands control to the
    # loop only when this is true; with nothing pending a run would otherwise block forever in the loop instead of
    # deadlock-detecting.

        # every reset, leaving pending() permanently true so the next run keeps handing control to a loop with
        # nothing to do. Unwinding everything is the whole contract of this method, so empty the tables outright

    # The key is the descriptor number, but a number is not an identity: the OS recycles it the moment a handle is
    # closed, so a slot can outlive the handle it was made for and be handed on to an unrelated one. The slot's
    # value is that handle, held here, so refaddr() is a stable identity for as long as the slot exists, and every
    # lookup compares the handle it was given against the handle actually stored. Believing the number alone is how
    # a fiber gets parked on a registration that will never fire: the new handle sees has_watch() true for a slot it
    # never made, the subclass skips registering it with the loop, and the slot's callback is never reached.

    # deadline, an await_read timeout) into a stall on that loop. Whether a loop can honour that is up to the loop:
    # IO::Async's loop_once(0) returns at once and still fires a due timer, while Mojo's one_tick takes no timeout at
    # all and always waits for the earliest registered timer, so Driver::Mojo's poll_ready is the same call as its
