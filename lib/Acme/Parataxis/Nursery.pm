# Structured concurrency: an enclosed block spawns child fibers that are all guaranteed to
# finish before the enclosing nursery returns, and that are all cancelled the moment any
# one of them fails. `Acme::Parataxis->nursery( sub ($n) { ... } )` builds one of these,
# runs the block in the calling fiber (the parent), joins every child, and rethrows the
# first failure as an Acme::Parataxis::Error::Nursery whose ->failures lists every child
# error (Principle 4: a plain aggregate error, no Java ExceptionGroup).
